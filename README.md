# TA/Lab Assignment: 

In this project, me (Anh Nguyen), Aayush Joshipura, Mirza Ahmeed, and Tung Giang are trying to implement evolutionary computing to assign teaching assistants to office hours or lab sections that best fits their availability and preferences. We try to create "agents" that resolve resource allocation problems (overallocation, undersupport, availability,...). We also design an optimizer that allows the code to run within the time limit. Finally, we adopted test-driven developments to make sure that the objectives are running properly. All of the code is written in Python.
